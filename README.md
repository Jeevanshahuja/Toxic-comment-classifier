# Toxic comment classifier
 **Toxic Comment Classifier**   This project is a web-based application that classifies user comments as toxic or non-toxic using a machine learning model. The application is built with Flask, TensorFlow, and a TF-IDF vectorizer to predict categories such as toxic, obscene, threat, and identity hate. Users can enter a comment to receive an immediate, lighthearted result, indicating if the comment is toxic or clean, enhancing online interactions by promoting respectful communication.
